Notes on Cobalt's drivers:

You will notice in several places constructs such as this:

	if (cobt_is_3k()) {
		foo();
	} else if (cobt_is_5k()) {
		bar();
	}

The goal here is to only compile in code that is needed, but to allow one to
define support for both 3k and 5k (and more?) style systems.  The systype
check macros are very simple and clean.  They check whether config-time
support for the generation has been enabled, and (if so) whether the current
systype matches the spcified generation.  This leaves the code free from 
#ifdef cruft, but lets the compiler throw out unsupported generation-specific 
code with if (0) detection.
